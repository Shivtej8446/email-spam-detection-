provided by SimplByte

ðŸ“š Project Overview:
In this project, I aimed to analyze and gain valuable insights. The aim of this project was to create an efficient and accurate email spam detection system. With the increasing volume of emails, it has become essential to identify and filter out spam emails to maintain inbox hygiene and protect users from potential threats.

ðŸ’¡ Key Objectives:
Steps:
1]Collect a dataset of spam and non-spam emails.
2]Clean and preprocess the text data.
3]Extract numerical features from the preprocessed data.
4]Train a machine learning model on the features.
5]Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset.
6]Refine the model through tuning and experimentation.
7]Deploy the model for automated spam detection.

ðŸ”§ Methodology:
-Data Collection
-Data Cleaning
-Data preprocessing
-Data Visualization
-feature extraction
